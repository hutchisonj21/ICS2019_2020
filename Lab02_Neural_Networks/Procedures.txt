This program was written in python 3.7 using the libraries sci-kit lean, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn. The data were collected from
https://www.kaggle.com/gsutters/the-human-freedom-index/data. Several unnecessary points of data were omitted. Six data points (procedural justice, civil justice, criminal justice, rule of
law, homicide, and disappearances) were used as inputs. The data were not scaled. The neural network was trained with sixty-percent of the data and tested with the remaining forty. The
hidden layer consisted of three layers each containing four nodes. The random_state was one, the cv was four, and the max_iter was two-thousand five-hundred. The accuracy of the neural
network was represented by the percentage of inputs correctly matched to the outputs. This accuracy was verified by using cross validation.
